title="SPRITE: a novel strategy-proof multi-unit double auction scheme for spectrum allocation in ubiquitous communications",
journal="Personal and Ubiquitous Computing",
year="2014",
month="Apr",
day="01",
volume="18",
number="4",
pages="939--950",
abstract="With the increasing number of handheld and mobile devices, the demand for available spectrum resource is experiencing a rapid growth. Auction has been widely used for spectrum resource allocation in ubiquitous communications due to its fairness. However, many existing spectrum auction schemes inherently limit users' ability to fully utilize the spectrum due to the assumption that the spectrum resource is single unit and indivisible. Besides, most of them fail to take into account of buyer/seller's distinctive demands in auction and consider spectrum allocation as single-sided auction. In this paper, we consider the multi-unit double auction problem under the context that multiple buyers/sellers have different demands to buy/sell. Particularly, we present a novel strategy-proof multi-unit double auction scheme (SPRITE). SPRITE establishes a series of bid-related buyer group construction and winner determination strategies. It improves the spectrum reusability and achieves sound spectrum utilization, fairness, and essential economic properties. In the theoretical analysis, we have shown the correctness, effectiveness, and economic properties of SPRITE and prove that SPRITE is strategy-proof. In the evaluation study, we further show that SPRITE can achieve multi-unit spectrum auction with better auction efficiency compared with existing double auction mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, SPRITE is the first multi-unit double auction approach that guarantees the competitive fairness among buyers while remaining strategy-proof for spectrum allocation. Furthermore, the multi-unit double auction mechanism proposed in this work helps increasing flexibility of the ubiquitous devices for spectrum usage.",

abstract = "While the Quality of Service (QoS) offered to users may be enhanced through innovativeذ protocols and new technologies, future trends should take into account the efficiency of resource allocation and network/terminal cooperation as well. Game theory techniques have widely been applied to various engineering design problems in which the action of one component has impact on (and perhaps conflicts with) that of any other component. Therefore, game formulations are used, and a stable solution for the players is obtained through the concept of equilibrium. This survey collects applications of game theory in wireless networking and presents them in a layered perspective, emphasizing on which fields game theory could be effectively applied. To this end, several games are modeled and their key features are exposed."

ABSTRACT="In this paper, we propose a distributed market mechanism powered by the
blockchain technology addressing network ownership models in multiple
telecommunications networks use cases. The proposed model is based on the
smart contract technology and enables transparent and trusted bilateral
trades, where trust among the network operators does not exist, and there
is no impartial third-party entity who is trusted by all of the
participants. We use an open source permissioned blockchain framework
called Hyperledger Fabric to investigate the performance of the distributed
market mechanism in cloud environments. After running experiments on
Hyperledger Fabric, we discuss the practical feasibility and possible
design choices of our blockchain approach based on latency, throughput and
resource consumption analysis."

A smart contract is executable code that runs on top of the blockchain to facilitate, execute and enforce an agreement between untrusted parties without the involvement of a trusted third party. A decentralised auction guarantees greater transparency and avoids cheating auctioneers. Since in Ethereum computation is expensive as transactions are executed and verified by all the nodes on Ethereum network, we analysed our implementation in terms of cost and time efficiency, obtaining promising results.",

abstract="The success of the Ethereum blockchain as a decentralized application platform with a distributed consensus protocol has made many organizations start to invest into running their business on top of it. Technically, the most impressive feature behind the success of Ethereum is its support for a Turing complete language. On the other hand, the inherent transparency and, consequently, the lack of privacy poses a great challenge for many financial applications. In this paper, we tackle this challenge and present a smart contract for a verifiable sealed-bid auction on the Ethereum blockchain. In a nutshell, initially, the bidders submit homomorphic commitments to their sealed-bids on the contract. Subsequently, they reveal their commitments secretly to the auctioneer via a public key encryption scheme. Then, according to the auction rules, the auctioneer determines and claims the winner of the auction. Finally, we utilize interactive zero-knowledge proof protocols between the smart contract and the auctioneer to verify the correctness of such a claim. The underlying protocol of the proposed smart contract is partially privacy-preserving. To be precise, no information about the losing bids is leaked to the bidders. We provide an analysis of the proposed protocol and the smart contract design, in addition to the estimated gas costs associated with the different transactions.",

Permissioned blockchains promise to deal with the issue of complete removal of trust, a notion that is currently the hallmark of the developed society. Before the idea is adopted in contexts where resource efficiency and fast operation is a requirement, one could legitimately ask the question: can permissioned blockchains match the performance of traditional large-scale databases? This paper compares two popular frameworks, Hyperledger Fabric and Apache Cassandra, as representatives of permissioned blockchains and distributed databases, respectively. We compare their latency for varying workloads and network sizes. The results show that, for small systems, blockchains can start to compete with traditional databases, but also that the difference in consistency models and differences in setup can have a large impact on the resulting performance.},

abstract = "Ethernet Passive Optical Network (EPON) has been widely considered as a promising technology for implementing the FTTx solutions to the “last mile” bandwidth bottleneck problem. Bandwidth allocation is one of the critical issues in the design of EPON systems. In an EPON system, multiple optical network units (ONUs) share a common upstream channel for data transmission. To efficiently utilize the limited bandwidth of the upstream channel, an EPON system must dynamically allocate the upstream bandwidth among multiple ONUs based on the instantaneous bandwidth demands and quality of service requirements of end users. This paper introduces the fundamental concepts on EPONs, discusses the major issues related to bandwidth allocation in EPON systems, and presents a survey of the state-of-the-art dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) algorithms for EPONs."

ABSTRACT="In this paper, we propose a distributed market mechanism powered by the
blockchain technology addressing network ownership models in multiple
telecommunications networks use cases. The proposed model is based on the
smart contract technology and enables transparent and trusted bilateral
trades, where trust among the network operators does not exist, and there
is no impartial third-party entity who is trusted by all of the
participants. We use an open source permissioned blockchain framework
called Hyperledger Fabric to investigate the performance of the distributed
market mechanism in cloud environments. After running experiments on
Hyperledger Fabric, we discuss the practical feasibility and possible
design choices of our blockchain approach based on latency, throughput and
resource consumption analysis."

   abstract = {After year 2000 with the introduction of third generation (3G) mobile networks a new type ofcooperation between competitors emerged, network sharing. Cost reduction is often mentionedas the main driver for network sharing. However, cost aspects are only part of the story “why”operators cooperate. In this paper we discuss multiple aspects of “why” operators cooperate andalso “how” competing mobile operators cooperate.Besides cost the “why” aspect is discussed in terms of market position, market entry andexploitation of the resources and skills of the sharing partner but also drawbacks of sharing. Thepatterns of cooperation are illustrated by analyzing how roles, responsibilities and resources canbe distributed among the mobile operators. The findings are based on case studies where wemake comparison in three different domains. In the time domain we compare network sharing inSweden the years 2000 and 2010. From a cost perspective the drivers to share networks havedecrease since many base station sites can be re-used. Anyway, new network sharing companiesare formed in order to make the network operation more efficient.We also compare cooperation between operators at the Swedish and Indian mobile markets. Inboth countries the competition is very strong. Network sharing is used but in India thecooperation is organized through tower companies, hence the operator cooperation is weak.Finally we look into network sharing principles for indoor network deployment in Sweden. Thecooperation between operators is strong but not as strong as for the network sharing jointventures. The tie between two operators can be said to be weaker since several mobile operators,the facility owner and also enterprises may be included in cooperation. In addition theinvestment risk is lower. },

abstract = "The traditional model of single ownership of all the physical network elements and network layers by mobile network operators is beginning to be challenged. This has been attributed to the rapid and complex technology migration compounded with rigorous regulatory requirements and ever increasing capital expenditures. These trends, combined together with the increasing competition, rapid commoditization of telecommunication equipments and rising separation of network and service provisioning are pushing the operators to adopt multiple strategies, with network infrastructure sharing in the core and radio access networks emerging as a more radical mechanism to substantially and sustainably improve network costs. Through infrastructure sharing, developing countries and other emerging economies can harness the technological, market and regulatory developments that have fostered affordable access to mobile and broadband services. Similarly, the network operators entering or consolidating in the emerging markets can aim for substantial savings on capital and operating expenses. The present paper aims to investigate the current technological solutions and regulatory and the technical–economical dimensions in connection with the sharing of mobile telecommunication networks in emerging countries. We analyze the estimated savings on capital and operating expenses, while assessing the technical constraints, applicability and benefits of the network sharing solutions in an emerging market context."

abstract = {Although a promising solution for next-generation radio access networks (RANs), cloud RAN (C-RAN) still faces technical challenges due to the separate locations of the cloud-based baseband unit (BBU) pool and remote radio heads (RRHs). Fortunately, time- and wavelength-division multiplexing passive optical networks (TWDM-PONs) can efficiently bridge the communications between the BBU pool and RRHs. In this work, we address the problem of formulating virtual time division multiplexing PONs (vTDM-PONs) adaptively in a TWDM-PON-based C-RAN. However, instead of relying on a centralized approach, we develop algorithms that can work in a distributed manner. Specifically, we consider a scenario in which the optical network unit (ONU) of each RRH has the initiative to choose a proper vTDM-PON to register to based on its knowledge on the C-RAN. We formulate game theoretic models for the vTDM-PON formation for both static and dynamic operation of a C-RAN, then transform the games into weighted potential games and therefore prove the existence of Nash equilibrium (NE) points in the games. Moreover, we propose a distributed algorithm that can converge to the NE point(s) to enable each ONU to choose its vTDM-PON intelligently. As a comparison, we formulate a centralized mixed-integer linear programming model to provide the optimum vTDM-PON formation solution. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the design of the proposed game models and distributed algorithm.},

The number of radio base stations and optical fiber lines between them is becoming larger. For this reason, we studied effective optical network technologies for mobile RANs and propose the use of TWDM-PON as a means of enabling RANs to be operated flexibly and have wideband communication capability. We confirmed the feasibility of TWDM-PON for this application by numerical simulation. The results show that TWDM-PON can accommodate the bandwidth more than TDM-PON and completely eliminate unused bandwidth in TDM-PON.},

abstract = "The energy sector is undergoing a massive transformation that greatly affects and is being affected by its market mechanisms. This paper presents the design, the prototype implementation and the analysis of a decentralized, real-time, uniform-price double auction energy market. The proposed market is a distributed and decentralized application and its rules may be specified through a smart contract. Market participants interact with the smart contract sending their asks and offers and the distributed application clears the market based on a uniform-price economic dispatch model. We propose and analyze three different implementation approaches on an Ethereum blockchain network. A model representing a physical demonstration project conducted in Seattle, USA, is utilized to simulate the power grid and to provide real-life scenarios for our analysis. We systematically evaluate our three implementation approaches and elucidate several blockchain issues regarding the decentralization of next-generation energy markets. In particular, we identify that certain computation modules may be installed on smart consuming devices in order to increase efficiency, security and decentralization and reduce the overall blockchain overhead cost. Furthermore, we show that in order to fulfill the market’s high demand for step timing, we ought to have the block generation time several magnitudes smaller compared to the auction period."

abstract = {Summary Blockchains are increasingly studied in the context of new applications. Permissioned blockchains promise to deal with the issue of complete removal of trust, a notion that is currently the hallmark of the developed society. Before the idea is adopted in contexts where resource efficiency and fast operation is a requirement, one could legitimately ask the question: can permissioned blockchains match the performance of traditional large-scale databases? This paper compares two popular frameworks, Hyperledger Fabric and Apache Cassandra, as representatives of permissioned blockchains and distributed databases, respectively. We compare their latency for varying workloads and network sizes. The results show that, for small systems, blockchains can start to compete with traditional databases, but also that the difference in consistency models and differences in setup can have a large impact on the resulting performance.},
